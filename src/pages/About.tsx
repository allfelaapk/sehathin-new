                you will have all the tools you need to make it easier for you
                to gain weight healthily.
                Tracking nutrition and physical activity is proven to be very
                effective in managing your healthy lifestyle. The more you track
                your nutrition, the higher your chances of gaining weight.
                That's why every successful gain weight program recommends you
                keep a food and/or exercise diary.
                Recording all meals and meals eaten without the necessary tools
                can be a tedious task, and most likely a tedious task. So,
                SehaThin strives to create the best conditions for recording
                food. After all, the easier it is for you to keep a food diary,
                the higher the chances that you will not deviate from the chosen
                path and successfully reach your goal.
